= DESCRIPTION:

As of right now, simply builds aegir from packages, and performs the small amount of manual setup (apt repos, sudo, etc).

Planning to add aegir slave recipes, as well as building from "source" (not packages) for easier customization and tweaking.

Currently tested on Debian Squeeze (32- and 64-bit).
